## Introduction

The **Particles** project focuses on shader programming using SDL and ShaderCross. It provides a platform to experiment with various shading languages, including GLSL, MSL, and DXIL. The goal is to create a better understanding of how shaders work across different graphics APIs.

## Getting Started

To begin using this project, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/IonuZes/particles/releases). Make sure to download the necessary files and execute them to start experimenting with shader technologies.

## Examples

This repository contains several examples that demonstrate the use of shaders in various contexts. Each example is designed to showcase specific features and capabilities of the shader languages supported.

### Example 1: Basic Shader

This example illustrates a simple shader that renders particles on the screen. It serves as a foundation for more complex effects.

### Example 2: Advanced Lighting

In this example, we explore advanced lighting techniques using shaders. You will learn how to implement different lighting models to enhance the visual quality of your graphics.

### Example 3: Post-Processing Effects

This example demonstrates how to apply post-processing effects using shaders. You'll see how to create effects like bloom and motion blur.

## Supported Technologies

The **Particles** project supports a range of technologies, including:

- **C**: The core programming language for this project.
- **DXIL**: A low-level intermediate representation for DirectX.
- **GLSL**: The OpenGL Shading Language.
- **MSL**: Metal Shading Language for macOS and iOS.
- **SPIR-V**: A binary intermediate language for representing shaders.
- **SDL**: Simple DirectMedia Layer for multimedia applications.
- **SDL3**: The latest version of SDL, providing new features and improvements.

## Installation
